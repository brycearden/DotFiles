Network Debugging
=================

First check the system log at:

	/var/log/syslog

Here is a list of other useful tools:
	Gotten from http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/50098/linux-network-troubleshooting-and-debugging

	1) 'ifconfig' - for obtaining information about network interfaces
	2) 'ping' - for validating, if target host is accessible from my machine.
			    ping also could be used for basic DNS diagnostics - we could
			    ping host by IP-address or by its hostname and then decide
			    if DNS works at all. And then traceroute or tracepath or mtr
			    to look what's going on on the way there.
	3) 'dig' - diagnose everything DNS
	4) 'dmesg | less' or 'dmesg | tail' or 'dmesg | grep -i error'
			For understanding what the linux kernal thinks about some
			trouble
	5) 'netstat -antp' - Shows information about TCP connections
	6) 'telnet <host> <port>' - is very useful for communicating with various
			TCP-services
	7) 'iptables-save' - to dump the full iptables tables
	8) 'ethtool' - get all the network interface card parameters (status of
			link, speed, offload parameters...)
	9) 'socat' - the swiss army tool to test all network protocols (UDP,
			multicast, SCTP...). Especially useful (more so than telnet) with
			a few -d options
	10) 'iperf' - to test bandwidth availability
	11) 'openssl' - to debug all SSL/TLS/PKI issues
	12) 'wireshark' - the powerful tool for capturing and analyzing network
			traffic, which allows to analyze and catch many network bugs.
	13) 'iftop' - show big users on the network/router
	14) 'iptstate' - current view of the firewall's connection tracking
	15) 'arp' - show the ARP-table status
	16) 'route' - show routing table status
	17) 'strace' - is useful tool which shows what system calls does the
			problem process, it also shows error codes (errno) when system
			calls fail. This information often says enough for understanding
			the system behavior and solving a problem.
