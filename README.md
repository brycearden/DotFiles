<h1>Overview</h1>
In this repository I keep all of my config files for vim, mercurial, and other
programs I use. I also have some cheat sheets and other miscellaneous files
that I use during development.

The installation script was inspired by (and mostly copied from) https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix.

<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>
In a terminal run the following commands in your home directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lemonade512/DotFiles.git
cd DotFiles
bin/install.sh
```
